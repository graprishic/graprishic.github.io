-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=hxh-edit-on-tumblr>#hxh Edit On Tumblr<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hxh-edit-on-tumblr>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://64.media.tumblr.com/d42ed583159e33544a344ecfe5e2db6b/4fa83b9b79c1fcd8-18/s640x960/e5d0871a04383baa7c72e2be5c9da9ed74d88d3c.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tNu2HN1CQb_qf18xOEF1QAHaHT&pid=15.1"' alt="#hxh edit on Tumblr"><p><em>Source: tumblr.com</em></p><blockquote><p>killua shalnark hxh.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion
