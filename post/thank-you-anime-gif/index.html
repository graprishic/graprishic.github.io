-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=thank-you-animated-by-miischaa-on-deviantart>Thank You! <em>animated</em> By Miischaa On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#thank-you-animated-by-miischaa-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/6644f2e9-dff9-4caa-9e96-1461c9cc73ee/d6e1d20-06685f45-f3ae-4920-ad12-b356fea3726b.gif?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzY2NDRmMmU5LWRmZjktNGNhYS05ZTk2LTE0NjFjOWNjNzNlZVwvZDZlMWQyMC0wNjY4NWY0NS1mM2FlLTQ5MjAtYWQxMi1iMzU2ZmVhMzcyNmIuZ2lmIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.ifVFa57YFN79qxBMK8NSzYRbc5mQeK9JoGkQQ6W0mFo" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.N_eZKzjRzE03SoVCxD5bbQHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="thank you! *animated* by miischaa on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>thank animated moving animation cute attention animations clipart clip deviantart cliparts pikachu powerpoint gifs thankyou clipartbest clipartmag favourites saying library.</p></blockquote><p>What is anime and why are people interested in it?
Anime is a genre of animation that typically follows the story lines of young people in Japan. It has been around since the late 1800s and has seen many changes over the years.
